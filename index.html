		      <h1>Zenless Zone Zero</h1>
			  <p>Zenless Zone Zero is an action role-playing game. The player assumes the role of a Proxy (the protagonist known as Wise or Belle), a character who helps others explore the hostile alternate dimensions called Hollows. As they advance, the Proxy will recruit new members known as Agents to their party as they continue to fight the Ethereal and other enemies. In addition to the Proxy, players also use assistants known as Bangboos.</p>
